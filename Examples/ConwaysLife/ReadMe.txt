This is an example using the Conway's Game of Life cucumber steps created by Corey Haines from:
http://github.com/coreyhaines/practice_game_of_life/tree/master/features/ 

In order to run these:

1. Build StorEvil & the examples (just open the solution and ctrl-shift-B).

2. Put storevil in your PATH (by default it will be built in Core/StorEvil/bin/debug).

3. Open a command prompt and navigate to this directory (Examples/ConwaysLife)

4. Run one of the following commands:
  storevil execute
  storevil execute -o ConwaysLife.storevil.output.html

Either of these commands will execute the game of life scenarios in the console. 
The second one will additionally generate an HTML report.

Thanks to Corey Haines for creating these steps.
